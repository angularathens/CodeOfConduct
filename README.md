# Angular Athens meetup Code of Conduct
Our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Athens/) has a code of conduct!

## In a nutshell

### Why?
Because we want everyone to feel welcome and at home.

### Who is not welcome?
We want everyone to feel welcome. By “everyone”, we mean “everyone who respects our code of conduct”.
We do not welcome sexists, racists, fascists, hate-speakers, hate-spreaders, tech-haters and tech-bullies. In short, anyone who tries to intimidate anyone, or anyone who will try to use our meetups to promote their hate (or their special belief in an aggressive way, or in a way that makes anyone feel uncomfortable).
If you identify with one of the aforementioned identities, then you should probably skip our meetup. Or try to hide your identity as well as you can. :)

### Rule of thumb
There is a general rule of thumb for such situations, called “[The Rock Test](https://medium.com/@annevictoriaclark/the-rock-test-a-hack-for-men-who-dont-want-to-be-accused-of-sexual-harassment-73c45e0b49af)”. So, don’t say to anyone what you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying to The Rock.
When you want to hate-speak about anyone, think that this “anyone” is “The Rock” and he’s overhearing.

## More Details
For our long version, we copy the “[Conf Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/)”, and as is suggested in the [Angular Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/angular/code-of-conduct). Where “conference” we mean “meetup”.

So, copied here, almost word for word (edited some things to apply):

### Conference Code of Conduct
All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### Need Help?
Contact one of the organizing team. Contact details can be found at [the bottom of this page](#contact-us).

### The Quick Version
Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.

### The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment also includes written offensive or suggestive language, that a participant might produce in a meetup activity (eg. the quiz).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. We will be sitting near the entrance or around the talking podium.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference venues.

## Some Clarifications
Our meetup is a place for us to meet (!), a place to have fun, a place to learn, a place to get inspired, a place to share knowledge, and of course a place to share opinions. Notice the word “share”. And notice its differences from the words: “impose”, “enforce”, “argue”, “shout about”, “shame anyone towards certain”. Do share opinions, but there is no shame for a certain opinion, there is no right or wrong, there is just a person who has a certain experience which formed their way of thinking.

In Greece, we are usually carried away by humour, by our loud attitudes, by the stereotypes which are so strong in our families, our workplaces, the television shows we watch, the mass produced culture. Such stereotypes usually include women, homosexuals and persons of other races, and men that have to live up to a tough image. These stereotypes are not to be reproduced in this meetup, even as a joke.
